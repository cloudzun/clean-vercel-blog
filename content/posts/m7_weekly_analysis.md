| 2 | NVDA | NVIDIA | $186.94 | +38.22% | 🥈 AI Chip Leader |
| 3 | AAPL | Apple | $261.73 | +8.84% | ✅ Stable but Sluggish |
| 4 | META | Meta | $649.81 | ~0% | ⚠️ Oscillating |
| 5 | TSLA | Tesla | $417.07 | ~0% | ⚠️ Under Pressure |
| 6 | MSFT | Microsoft | $401.84 | -1.40% | ❌ Short-term Struggle |
| 7 | AMZN | Amazon | $199.60 | -13.36% | ❌ Clear Laggard |

### 1.2 Key Financial Metrics Comparison

- TSLA: Extremely high volatility, prone to short squeezes or crashes
- NVDA: High volatility, significant chasing risk

## Part 2: News-Driven Factors Analysis

### 2.1 SearxNG News Collection Results

#### GOOG (Alphabet) - Positive Narrative
**Key News**:
- "Alphabet stock sinks after Google parent announces $180 billion..." (appears negative, actually AI investment commitment)
- Gemini AI commercialization progressing
- Search market share stable, advertising revenue resilient

**Analysis**: Despite short-term stock adjustment, AI investment commitment released long-term growth signals. Market has digested and repriced accordingly.

- Downstream customers (Meta, Google, Tesla) GPU purchasing frenzy continues
- Supply chain tight, capacity becomes bottleneck

**Analysis**: Demand-side news extremely certain, supporting high valuation. As long as this demand doesn't weaken, stock has upside momentum.

#### AAPL (Apple) - Regulatory Risk
**Key News**:

## Part 3: Deep Analysis Based on Expert Framework

### 3.1 Catalyst Mapping

#### Near-term Catalysts (1-2 weeks)

| Company | Catalyst | Expected Impact | Timeline |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| MSFT | Q2 Earnings + Azure Growth | Critical | Next Week |
| GOOG | Gemini Commercialization | Positive | This Week |
| NVDA | Downstream Capex News | Positive | Ongoing |
| AAPL | iPhone AI Launch | Neutral | March |
| AMZN | AWS Growth Data | Critical | Next Week |
| META | Capex Guidance | Critical | This Month |
| TSLA | Robotaxi Launch | High Risk | TBD |

### 3.2 Narrative Verification

#### Why GOOG Leads While MSFT Lags?

**Data Phenomenon**:
- Both are cloud computing leaders
- Both investing heavily in AI
- Yet GOOG +65% vs MSFT -1% over 1 year

**News Narrative**:
- GOOG: Gemini gaining market acceptance, AI strategy clear
- MSFT: OpenAI relationship unclear, Azure ROI questioned

**Logic Chain**:
Though financial data similar, market prices **AI commercialization path certainty** differently. Google's Gemini widely accepted; Microsoft's Copilot commercialization progress disappoints.

**Conclusion**: Not fundamental difference, but **expectation gap** driving valuation divergence.

### 3.3 Risk Discount Model

#### AAPL's Regulatory Risk

**Negative News**: DOJ antitrust litigation
**Impact Mechanism**:
- Short-term: Valuation multiple suppression
- Medium-term: Business model change risk (forced sideloading)
- Long-term: Potential profit margin decline

**Quantitative Impact**:
- Normal case: P/E 35-40x
- Under regulatory risk: P/E 30-33x (current level)
- **Recommendation**: Reduce target price 5-10% until litigation clarifies
